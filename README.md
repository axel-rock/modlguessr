# ModlGuessr

This game is my submission for the [Modern Stack Hackathon](https://www.convex.dev/hackathons/modernstack)

ModlGuessr is a game where you need to find which Large Language Model you're talking with.

I was looking for a fun idea to built with [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) and [Autumn](https://useautumn.com/)
