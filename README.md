# ModlGuessr

This game is my submission for the [Modern Stack Hackathon](https://www.convex.dev/hackathons/modernstack)

ModlGuessr is a game where you need to find which Large Language Model you're talking with. Inspired by GeoGuessr.

I was looking for a fun idea to built with [Convex](https://convex.dev/referral/AXELRO9828), [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) and [Autumn](https://useautumn.com/)

## Gameplay

You pick a difficulty. Easy, medium, hard
You enter a chat room
You're faced with a description of the AI's persona. ie: "This AI believes it's in the year 1995. Modern references will confuse it."
You can chat with the LLM, now knowing which one it is.
There are 4 models to chose from
As soon as you start chatting, a countdown starts
You must pick one of the 4 options before the timer reaches the max.
The longer you take to find which one it is, the less points you get
This loop repeats 7 times
In the end, you get a score and enter a leaderboard

The more correct answers you get in a row, the more you increase a streak multipler
A fast LLM checks you managed to force the LLM to tell its name. If you did, you get an extra multiplier.

## Business model

This is a hackathon project, not a very serious business idea. But, maybe it'll be fun enough, and most of all, I want to implement Autumn and see how it works in a real situation.

So here is the planned model:

- Freemium, with a few free games (ie: 3) initally
- 1 free game per day
- Small subscription plan 9â‚¬/mo for more games per month
- One time payment, higher price price per ticket
- Pay as you go for unlimited play

## Features to implement
