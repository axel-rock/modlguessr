Okay, so it's the day before the end of the hackathon and I've implemented all the technicalities like auth, payments, real-time leaderboard, deployment, prod, and testing. I added the domain, game difficulty, grab the models from Vercel, call the AI (of course set your username, referral ton of shit). The core of the game is not very fun currently. It just opens a blank chat and it doesn't make it very engaging or trigger any form of creativity. You probably want to ask the same thing over and over again and just cross your fingers that the LLM is going to respond. I need to implement something to spice it up a little bit. What I'm thinking is that as many chat apps you shouldn't let the burden to do user to decide what to type first. It's too much decision, so let's try to steer the initial conversation.
