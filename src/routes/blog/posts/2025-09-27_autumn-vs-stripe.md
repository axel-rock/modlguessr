You'll understand this video only if you've worked with Stripe I think.

It takes me 16 minutes with [Autumn](https://useautumn.com) to setup the entire pricing model most startups want to build: Free tier, pro plan, Pay as you go, one time payment and even referral, all easily editable.

I don't only say that because of the Hackathon. I genuinely think all early-ish startups should seriously consider not using Stripe directly. Autumn is nuts, support on Discord was amazing. I'd like to try Polar two, which seem to offer different benefits.

Full disclosure, this is only the dashboard setup. It's already impressive. I am not showing the code part, but trust me, it's also MUCH easier than working with Stripe directly.
