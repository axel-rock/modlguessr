Already a few days into the hackathon, and I woke up this morning with a design dilemma: what should my project actually look like?

## Breaking my usual patterns

I think hackathons are the perfect opportunity to do fun stuff you'd never attempt in a real project. So I made a decision: no component libraries, no recycling styles from my other projects (which is totally what I usually do to save time).

Instead, I decided to scroll through social media for inspiration. Sometimes the best ideas come from the most unexpected places.

## Finding inspiration

That's when I stumbled upon [Crazy Creative](https://crazycreative.design/) and was absolutely blown away.

Look, I'm just a developer. I don't have anywhere near the design skills of this artist, and I'm definitely not planning to make real money from this hackathon project. But their color scheme and font combination? _Chef's kiss_ - they look incredible together.

I wish I had the skills to create illustrations like theirs, but that's way beyond my current abilities.

## Giving credit where it's due

I wanted to make sure this amazing artist gets proper credit for their work. I'm not trying to take credit for their creativity - I'm simply borrowing their brilliant color palette and typography pairing that completely caught my eye.

Sometimes the best thing you can do as a developer is recognize great design when you see it and give props to the real artists who make the web beautiful.
